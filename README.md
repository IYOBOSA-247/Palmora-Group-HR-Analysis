# Palmora-Group-HR-Analysis
My first Project in Digital skill Up
## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes HR data from Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company with operations across three regions in Nigeria. The goal was to uncover key issues related to gender balance, salary fairness, performance ratings, and bonus distribution.

Using Power BI, I cleaned the data, created insightful visuals, and calculated bonuses based on performance rules. The analysis highlights areas where the company can improve â€” such as addressing gender imbalance in some departments, reviewing salary gaps, and ensuring fair bonus allocation.

The final dashboard and insights are designed to help Palmoria Group make more inclusive, transparent, and data-driven HR decisions as they plan for future growth.
